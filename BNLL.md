## Blunt-nosed leopard lizard research | Physiological Ecology of Reptiles Lab @ Cal Poly SLO
#### Lizard Osmoregulation
- Studied seasonal changes of evaporative water loss in Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizards (BNLL)
- Captured and handled BNLL (20 individuals), used telemetry to track BNLL
- Studied evaporative water loss in Western Fence Lizards and the effects of climate change on BNLL osmoregulation
- Lassoed 200+ fence lizards and recorded their sex, mass, and plasma osmolality
- Mastered lizard blood & plasma sampling methods, safely handling herpetofauna, and data collection

#### Dietary Water Study
- Led research project comparing environmental data in Carrizo Plain and the water content of BNLL prey
- Collecting samples of various arthropods from 2023 wet year to compare to drought-impacted conditions in 2021
- Leading and training groups of undergraduate students in arthropod sampling techniques and data collection
