## Transgenerational stress physiology | Ensminger Stress Physiology Lab @ SJSU
Studying the transgenerational impact of stress can aid in predicting long-term consequences of stress in a species. When organisms are presented with increased physiological stress across generations, physiological and behavioral tradeoffs can emerge so that the organism can survive in a more stressful environment 

For my master's I'm studying the relationship between maternal stress levels and offspring immune function. Using wild-caught, gravid western fence lizards I'll simulate ecologically relevant stress in the mothers before oviposition. I'll then compare the neonates' rate of wound healing to identify if there is a difference in offspring from stressed vs. not stressed mothers. 

Past studies have emphasized that transgenerational stress can manifest in wildlife from environmental stressors and predators. This project will inform future studies about reptiles' stress response and their ability to adapt to novel stressors. The more we know about maternal stress impacts on wound healing, the more we will be able to mitigate the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances for reptiles through predictive modeling and habitat management plans.
